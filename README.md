# Community Fridge Application

The Community Fridge App is a full-stack application which allows users to find, add, and update details of community refrigerators in their neighborhood.

Community fridges are free and open-access to any individual or family in need of fresh or canned foods. They run on an unofficial motto of "take what you need, leave what you can."
